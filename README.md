## Summary

The Get Dressed Club a self care fullstack CRUD app for friends to take care of themselves and eachother during quarantine. Users can get outfit themes for the day, submit daily logs of their self care routine, and offer or ask for support if they are struggling. 

## Motivation
 
The Get Dressed Club is inspired from a text thread that was started during the begininng of the COVID-19 quaratine. It is intended to give users a place to track their own self care habits, get a fun outfit theme for the day, and provide and ask for support. Instead of traditional social media that mainly focuses on the more notable and exciting moments, this app intended to give users a place to focus on their own self care and create community with their close friends. The app is designed to be reminisent of early 2000s internet to give users a nostalgic feel and remind them of when we were kids and did not have such big worries. 

## API Endpoints
This CRUD app has several endpoints. The get endpoints include one that returns all the daily logs, one that returns an outfit theme for the day. The post end points enable users to create a username, or add a log. The users can also update their log information with a patch endpoint and delete a log with a delete endpoint.
